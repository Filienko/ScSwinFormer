# Introduction:

scFormer, a Transformer-based model, can annotate cell types.

Instructions and examples are provided in the following tutorials. This code contains the data preprocessing and cell annotation process.

From the paper: scFormer: A Transformer-Based Cell Type Annotation Method for scRNA-seq Data Using Smooth Gene Embedding and Global Features

# Requirement:

Python==3.8.0
PyTorch >= 1.5.0
numpy==1.22.4
pandas==1.2.2
scipy==1.8.1
sklearn==1.9.1
Scanpy==1.9.1

# Usage:

python scFormer.py

in which

k=2000 Pre-processing selection of 2000 highly variable genes
s=The length of Smooth gene embedding dimension
scFormer(input_size, output_size)
input_size = n_top_genes
output_size = labels_size

Before running scFormer,please modify your file path and names (two files: the preprocessed scRNA-seq data file and its cell-type file). Please make sure your data file format: count matrix dimension is (genes*cells), label dimension is (1*cells).

Example data can be found in https://figshare.com/s/7651fa9725807dfb3dbcï¼ŒSave to file path 'data/Adipose/'.
